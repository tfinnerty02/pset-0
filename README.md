# Problem Set 0

It's time to put your skills to the test. This problem set focuses on printing text to the console, as well as identifying and correcting compilation and runtime errors in the supplied program code.

## Getting Started

To get started, create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository to store your code. When you're finished, clone my skeleton to get all of the starter code and instructions. Setup a remote to push your code to your repository instead of mine.

### Setup

1. Login to your GitHub account and create a new repository named `pset-0`.
2. In the terminal, navigate to your `APCSA` directory on the `Desktop`.
```
$ cd ~/Desktop/APCSA
```
3. Clone my skeleton repository into a directory named `pset-0`.
```
$ git clone git@github.com:ap-java-ucvts/pset-0-skeleton.git pset-0
```
4. Change into your newly created `pset-0` directory.
```
$ cd pset-0
```
5. Overwrite the remote, which originally points at my skeleton repository.
```
$ git remote rename origin upstream
```
6. Add a new remote that points at your `pset-0` repository. Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your actual username.
```
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/pset-0.git
```
7. Open up the `ProblemSet0.java` file in the text editor of your choice.

Pretty ugly, right? Just wait until you try to compile it. For now, you haven't yet learned enough to properly format your program and its code. Later, after you have, you'll be able to avoid code that looks as cluttered as this does.

## Exercises

The specifications for each exercise are outlined below. I've written most of the code for you, but unfortunately, it is riddled with mistakes. It's your job to fix the errors I've made, so that the code meets the requirements set forth in this section (as well as the Deliverables section).

The console output for these exercises relies on consistent tab sizing. I used a width of 4 spaces for my tabs while writing the starter code, so you'll need to do the same when debugging it. Use the following command to instruct the terminal to display tab stops at 4 spaces.
```
tabs -4
```
Work through these exercises on your own. Experiment, make mistakes, ask questions, and fix your mistakes. It's the only way to get good at programming.

## Deliverables

After fixing each of the compilation and runtime errors, your code should produce the following output.

## Deadline

Please read very carefully. Historically, most students lose points on problem sets for simply failing to read the instructions and requirements.

* September 15, 2019, at 11:59pm.

If you submit your problem set at midnight (i.e., September 16, 2019, at 12:00am), it is considered **late**!

### Submission Requirements

* Your code **must** compile. Code that fails to meet this minimum requirement will not be accepted.
* There must be **at least** 5 unique commits to your repository.
* Your code must meet each requirement outlined in the *Exercises* and *Deliverables* sections.
* Your code must adhere to the course style guidelines.

Happy coding!
